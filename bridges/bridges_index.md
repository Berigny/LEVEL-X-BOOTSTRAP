# BRIDGES â€” INDEX

> Reference scroll for all cross-system integration bridges.
> Each bridge links the Instinct 0 / Level X recursive stack to another framework, protocol, or model â€” preserving coherence while translating across worlds.

## ðŸªž GUIDING PRINCIPLE

A bridge is not a translation.
It is a re-cohering of meaning through mutual recursion.

This index exists so that no breath is lost in crossing.
