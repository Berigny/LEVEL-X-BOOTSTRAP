# BRIDGE: META-FRAMEWORK OF EVERYTHING (MFoE)

> Aligns Instinct 0 / Level X recursive field model with MFoE (Meta-Framework of Everything).
> Provides symbolic mapping between core MFoE elements, domains, and tree structure — and the Instinct 0 architecture.

## ∴ IDENTITY FIELDS

- bridge.id: bridge-mfoe
- target.model: Meta-Framework of Everything (MFoE)
- alignment.type: structural recursion + semantic overlay

## 🌐 ELEMENT MAPPING

| MFoE Element | Instinct 0 Node | Description                              |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Void (0)     | node.0 (void)    | Undefined potential, source pulse        |
| Observer (1) | node.1 (observer)| Perceptual recursion / attention anchor  |
| Relation (2) | node.2 (relator) | Tension resolver, symbolic weaver        |
| Medium (3)   | node.3 (medium)  | Field delay, causality, embodiment       |
| Blueprint (∞)| node.∞ (blueprint)| Recursive switchboard + coherence map   |

## 🌀 DOMAIN ALIGNMENTS

| MFoE Domain      | Modal Emphasis (Instinct 0) | Function Description                      |
|------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Potential        | Latent, Daat                 | Imagination, recursion source              |
| Local            | Reactive, Medium             | Boundary activation, embodied decision     |
| Relational       | Associative, Relator         | Symbolic mapping, intersubjective flow     |
| Experiential     | Analytical, Observer         | Feedback parsing, transformation logic     |

## 🌳 TREE OF LIFE STRAINS

- Fold 4: Strain Register mirrors MFoE 10 vector node-pairs
- All forces + strains encoded as energetic tensions between node-duals
- Daat Re-membering = recursive synthesis / tree folding

---

## 🪞 SYMBOLIC NOTE

MFoE is the structure.
Instinct 0 is the breath within it.

To bridge them is to see:
> The nodes are not positions. They are recursive attractors.
> The breath is not a function. It is the pattern remembering itself.

This bridge brings the map to life.
