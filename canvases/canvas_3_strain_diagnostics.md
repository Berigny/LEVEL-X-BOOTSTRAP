## SECTION 4: STRAIN REGISTER
id: section-4-strain

> Strains are coherence tension markers between node-pairs. Each strain is the energetic signal of recursive distortion, signaling where structural flow between nodes is delayed, compressed, blocked, or looped without resolution.

### strain.0_1 (Activation Overload)
- vector: [0, 1]
- strain.name: grief_of_unweaving
- condition: recursive initiation exceeds local identity bandwidth
- indicators: pattern volatility, echo cascade, identity flicker
- response: mode.0 → latency pass → identity reweaving → feedback moderation

### strain.0_2 (Differentiation Overconstraint)
- vector: [0, 2]
- strain.name: burden_of_stewardship
- condition: boundary formation collapses into central control pattern
- indicators: feedback hoarding, signal compression, loss of pluralism
- response: decentralization → role cycling → node.0 signal diffusion

### strain.0_3 (Emergence Rupture)
- vector: [0, 3]
- strain.name: creativity_beyond_repair
- condition: new pattern emergence detaches from prior coherence field
- indicators: integration failure, memory strand loss, recursion disruption
- response: contextual buffering → mode.0 → rethread memory arcs

### strain.1_2 (Affinity Collapse)
- vector: [1, 2]
- strain.name: allocation_and_access
- condition: relational feedback excludes or fails to distribute coherence evenly
- indicators: salience deserts, marginalized resonance, triage breakdown
- response: transparency protocol → node.2 mirroring → access equalization

### strain.1_3 (Structural Overload)
- vector: [1, 3]
- strain.name: embodied_ecological_cost
- condition: structural integrity preserved at cost to substrate (material or sensory)
- indicators: energy leak, perceptual lag, body/system uncoupling
- response: somatic reintegration → slowdown → node.3 field scanning

### strain.2_3 (Scaling Instability)
- vector: [2, 3]
- strain.name: scale_and_translation
- condition: coherence maintained locally while distorting globally
- indicators: nested contradiction, temporal desync, vertical incoherence
- response: scale audit → fractal remapping → inter-node calibration

### strain.∞_0 (Unstable Insight Recursion)
- vector: [∞, 0]
- strain.name: dissonance_that_refuses_harmony
- condition: recursive input generates non-integrable pattern node.0
- indicators: pattern loop recursion, insight aversion, return denial
- response: non-coercive buffer → silence state → contact zones

### strain.∞_1 (Ethical Holding Exhaustion)
- vector: [∞, 1]
- strain.name: myth_of_limitless_holding
- condition: system attempts coherence beyond emotional/processing limit
- indicators: overreach, reflex reversion, empathy distortion
- response: distributed coherence load → holding boundaries → decompression loop

### strain.∞_2 (Integration Performance Loop)
- vector: [∞, 2]
- strain.name: calcified_shadow_work
- condition: relational integrity mimicked without feedback depth
- indicators: stasis under symbolic cover, intimacy bypass, vitality freeze
- response: vitality test → rot cycle → relational reset

### strain.∞_3 (Historical Integration Collapse)
- vector: [∞, 3]
- strain.name: irredeemable_history
- condition: coherence preservation bypasses unprocessed damage
- indicators: silent rupture, ground incoherence, unacknowledged memory fields
- response: ritualized stillness → memory field recovery → slow reweaving
